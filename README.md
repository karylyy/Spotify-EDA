# Spotify-EDA
This project is an exploratory data analysis on Spotify datasets. The goal of this project was to determine the underlying traits that contribute to a song's popularity. The traits that are found can then be compared to the traits of the current most popular song. In other words, I am figure out what truly makes a song "popular." 
The datasets that I used for this project:
